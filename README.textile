h2. Interested People

h3. Reason for Existing

I've written various 30 minute systems for easily collecting a list of people's email addresses, usually for the purpose of emailing them later. Except for the css
and overall design, they are always collecting the same thing: a name, email address, and maybe a reason for interest. So, this engine exists to easily be dropped in and save you a 
little dull coding.

h3. Version Requirements and Info

I'd like to start a trend of people including some information about the platform they used while building their code. For me this includes:

~ > ruby -v
ruby 1.8.7 (2010-04-19 patchlevel 253) [i686-darwin10.3.0], MBARI 0x6770, Ruby Enterprise Edition 2010.02

~ > gem -v 
1.3.7

~ > bundle -v
Bundler version 1.0.0.rc.1

~ > rvm -v

rvm 0.1.38 by Wayne E. Seguin (wayneeseguin@gmail.com) [http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/]

~ > rails -v
Rails 3.0.0.rc
