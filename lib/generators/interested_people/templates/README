===============================================================================

Congrats, InterestedPeople is now installed. A couple notes:

  1. Make sure you've configured the after_submit_url correctly (defaults to /).
     You can change this in config/initializers/interested_people.rb.

  2. Copy the migration from the engine into your application and run:
  
      $ rake interested_people_engine:install:migrations
      $ rake db:migrate
